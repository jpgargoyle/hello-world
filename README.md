# hello-world
Tutorial stuff :P

Looks like this works like a wiki.

## This is a type 2 header
Made with `##`

Looks like this is equivalent
-----------------------------
Underlining with `-`

**bold** or __bold__

*underline* and _underline_

1. Ordered list 1 `1.`
2. Ordered list 2 `2.`
 Â * unordered `*`
3. Ordered list 3 `3.`

* unordered `*`
- unordered `-`
+ unordered `+`


And  finally, `CODE`
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
